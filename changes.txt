entity.current_pax_capacity -> entity.current_capacity()
C130.evacuate(apod,number) -> C130.evacuate_civilians()
apod.get_liftables() -> apod.get_mobile_liftables()
entity.air_lift(liftable) -> entity.load_entities() then entity.airlift_entities()
entity.air_drop(apod, to_territory, num_supplies) -> entity.airdrop_supplies(to_territory, num_supplies)
airdrop_supplies is now in day phase

land_connections!=None -> land_connections!=[]
airlift_entities now does all entities (not just one)

it seems that drop_pax no longer takes the territory. The same with drop_supply

added interdict

it seems that healing is now done automatically

evacuate is now in day phase rather than dawn phase
